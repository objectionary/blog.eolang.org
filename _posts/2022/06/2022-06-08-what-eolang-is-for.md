title: "What EO is for?"

[EO](https://www.eolang.org) is a new experimental programming language.
EO is not planning to become a mainstream language&mdash;this is not what
we want. Our main goal is to prove to ourselves that true object-oriented
programming is practically possible. Not just in books and abstract
examples, but in real code that works. That's why EO is being created&mdash;to
put all that "crazy" pure object-oriented ideas into practice and
see whether they can work.

At the moment we use EO as an intermediate representation (IR) for
static analysis. [Polystat](https://www.polystat.org) is the static
analyzer that is using EO.

We are planning to keep this blog running, to update you
with all new features in the language. If you want to contribute
too, just [email](mailto:team@eolang.org) us.
