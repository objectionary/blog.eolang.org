Since 0.23.15 version it is possible to use
[`number`](https://github.com/objectionary/home/blob/master/objects/org/eolang/math/number.eo)
object just like this:

```
# this is 7
(QQ.math.number -7).abs
```

It is a decorator of `int` and `float` objects with the following additional attributes:

<!--more-->

`is-int` - is this number is int (/bool)

`is-float` - is this number is float (/bool)

`xor` - bitwise xor operation, only for int (/int)

`or` - bitwise or operation, only for int (/int)

`and` - bitwise and operation, only for int (/int)

`left` - bitwise left shift operation, only for int (/int)

`right` - bitwise right shift operation, only for int (/int)

`neq` - this number not equal to another number (/bool)

`mod` - modulo operation (right now just for /int)

`abs` - absolute value (/int or /float)

`pow` - make this number power of another number (/int or /float)

`as-float` - converts this number to float (/float)

`as-int` - converts this number to int (/int)

`as-string` - converts this number to int (/string)

`signum` - sign of this number (/int of /float)

Return values depends on type of provided number.
