EO compilation process consists of several steps covered in details
in [this blog post](https://www.yegor256.com/2021/10/21/objectionary.html). Most
of the steps have various files (`.eo`, `.xmir`, etc.) as their input/output, and
sometimes it's very handy to have them persisted somewhere for reuse between
compilation runs. `~/.eo/` folder acts as such persistent storage.
Let's have a closer look at its structure and how it is bound to compilation process.

The folder has the following structure:

```
~/.eo/
   |-- pulled/
   |-- parsed/
   +-- optimized/
```

Each subfolder can be considered as a local cache serving specific purpose. All caches
store files based on version _git-hash_. For example `org.eolang.array` object source for version
`0.27.0` within `Pulled` cache will be stored as `~/.eo/pulled/99b64cf/org/eolang/array.eo`,
where `99b64cf` is git-hash for `0.27.0` version tag.
Also, note that the file path corresponds to the package of the object.

`Pulled` cache contains `.eo` sources downloaded from [Objectionary](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/blob/master/README.md)
during [Pull](https://www.yegor256.com/2021/10/21/objectionary.html#pull) step.
Every time `pull` step is executed it first checks presence of the file in `pulled` cache and would
only go to remote _Objectionary_ in case it's missing locally. However, this behaviour can be adjusted by
Maven `-U` option (see [Bypassing object cache](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/blob/master/eo-maven-plugin/README.md#bypassing-object-cache))

`Parsed` cache stores parsed `.xmir` files produced during [Parse](https://www.yegor256.com/2021/10/21/objectionary.html#parse-) step.
The structure of this folder is similar to `pulled` cache, namely it stores files based on hash+package:
`parsed/99b64cf/org/eolang/array.xmir`
An EO object discovered during previous compilation cycles and which has meaningful version
(i.e. not like `0.0.0`, `*.*.*` or empty) before actually being parsed would be checked in
`parsed` cache first. If it's found it will be copied to corresponding target. In case it's missing
it would be parsed from EO source.

`Optimized` cache is used during [Optimize](https://www.yegor256.com/2021/10/21/objectionary.html#optimize-) step and
stores optimized `.xmir` files. It is functioning identical to `Parsed` cache.

To summarize: `~/.eo/` folder represents local file cache for EO compilation artifacts to make
the process more performant. It's possible that for further optimizations we will see more caches within `~/.eo/` in future.

And of course to clean up all caches you can always execute (for Bash) `rm -rf ~/.eo` :)
